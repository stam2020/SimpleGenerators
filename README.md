## About The Project

I always believe that everything should be simple.
<br>
So when I discovered that so little generator servers exist, I thought to develop this plugin, and make generator servers accessible to everyone. 

Why you should use this plugin:
* Fast, efficient and powerful
* Very configurable and flexible


I hope that you will find this plugin useful!

A great [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ6dVJdGnig) made by erha8, demonstrating how to use the commands and the config file to make a server

### Built With

This plugin is built using
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
* [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)




## Getting Started

To download the plugin, visit [SimpleGenerators](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simplegenerators.94621/)

### Prerequisites

Requires the following plugins:
* [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault)
* Any economy plugin, such as [Essentials](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)

If you want support for placeholders:
* [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)


## Usage

To define a new generator, run in game the command 
```
/sg generator add <id> <name> <lore> <block> <drop> <upgrade_price> <tier>
```
Where \<id> is a unique name for the generator, \<name> is the name of the generator, \<lore> is its lore, \<block> is what block it is, \<drop> is what is drops, \<upgrade_price> is how much it costs to upgrade it, and \<tier> is how good it is (The higher the better)

If the name, or the lore have a space in them, it's important to put them in quotation marks.

It's also possible to add a generator directly from the config.yml file. The default one has an example of how to define one.

You can remove a generator by either deleting it in the config.yml file, or by using the command
```
/sg generator remove <id>
```
Where \<id> is the id of one of the existing generators.

You can edit a generator either from the config.yml file, or by using the command
```
/sg generator edit <id> <proprety> <value>
```
Which allows you to change a property of a generator. 

You can get one of the generators by using
```
/sg generator get <id>
``` 
Which gives you the generator with the id of /<id>

The generators drop items, which must also be defined. You can add an item using the command
```
/sg item add <item> <name> <lore> <sell_price>
```
Where \<item> is the type of item, \<name> is its name, \<lore> is its lore, and \<sell_price> is for how much it sells for when using the /sell command

Just like generators, you can edit and remove items by using 
```
/sg item remove <item>
/sg item edit <item> <proprety> <value>
```

It's also possible to define "wands" that can sell every sellable item in a chest. To define a sellwand, you can create one through the config.yml file, or run the command
```
/sg sellwand add <id> <name> <lore> <item> <multiplier>
``` 
Where the id is a unique name you give the sellwand, \<name> is its name, \<lore> is its lore, \<item> is what type of item the sellwand is, and \<mutliplier> is by how much the received from selling will by multiplied (mush be a whole number) 
Similarly to items and generators, you can also edit and remove sellwand using
```
/sg sellwand remove <id>
/sg sellwand edit <id> <proprety> <value>
```
It's possible to give yourself a sellwand by using
```
/sg sellwand get <id>
``` 

To change the frequency of the drops of the generators, change the drop_frequency field in the config, for example:
```yaml
drop_frequency: 100
```
Will make generators drop every 100 ticks, meaning 5 seconds.

If you want to require players to be on the server for their generators to work, set the field ```generate_offline``` to false. Be careful, setting it to true might cause a-lot of lag!
 
You can also limit the maximum amount of generators a player can place down, by giving them or their rank the permission node: ```simplegenerators.max_gen.NUMBER```. For example the permission node ```simplegenerators.max_gen.5``` will allow them to place down 5 generators.
 
To reload the config in-game, run:
```sh
/sg reload
```
